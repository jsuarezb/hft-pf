# Running the project

It's advised to use `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment and install pip dependencies.

After installing `pip`, run:

```bash
pip install -f requirements.txt
```

That will install all the project dependencies.

If you want to run the program, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```
